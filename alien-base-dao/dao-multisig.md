# DAO Multisig

As of November 27, following the successful [AIP-2 Vote](https://snapshot.org/#/alienbase-dex.eth/proposal/0xea788bd0daf9fb61acb0199874abc56f9c871cc2e117c3c1c11a45ba1ced7f52), Alien Base has a DAO Multisig wallet located at [https://basescan.org/address/0x4ab9070b7680f802cbf8322e597a4409902171e5](https://basescan.org/address/0x4ab9070b7680f802cbf8322e597a4409902171e5).

The DAO wallet receives 15% of all ALB emissions, which serve to bootstrap the Alien Base treasury. The treasury emissions minted so far have been transferred from their temporary holding address: [https://basescan.org/tx/0xf09c68cb4f1fe21041e1e0059facdb5aa08af9eb3e5fe9e4d8dcabdc464dad3f](https://basescan.org/tx/0xf09c68cb4f1fe21041e1e0059facdb5aa08af9eb3e5fe9e4d8dcabdc464dad3f)

* GotMyGat — "I'm a finance and accounting expert (CPA) out from Canada. My experience ranges from small, mid to large accounting firms, all the way up to corporates. I've been involved in DeFi since 2015 and as a result I believe my experience is valuable. I am well aware of OPSEC guidelines when it comes to operating within a DAO. My experience as an information systems auditor helps me understand operational security when it comes to multi-sigs. I am glad to be working alongside the team by being present in this opportunity."
